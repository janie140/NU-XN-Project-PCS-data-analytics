Portland Community Squash data enablement project - MONITORING MEMBER ENGAGEMENT AT PORTLAND COMMUNITY SQUASH

As a non-profit organization, Portland Community Squash (PCS) has a mission to build an accessible community center that fosters unity, supports its members holistically, and promotes social capital development. PCS today is focused on squash in Portland, Maine, but aspires to extend its model to multi-sport organizations as well as communities in other geographies.

There are a total of five types of datasets provided by PCS within three primary systems of record: Insightly (CRM), ClubLocker (reservation management), and iPad check-in at the door.

The inclusion of historical data, such as the season records file, enables trend analysis and long- term performance assessment. While the Insightly reports provide relatively detailed information, capturing individual member activities and participation in various programs and interventions, they suffer from data quality issues, including missing or inconsistent data. For instance, columns like membership type, starting date, milestones date, and ratings are inadequately filled out. The ClubLocker reservation file faces similar issues, with some important columns inconsistently completed.

The use of systems like Insightly and iPad check-ins provides real-time data, enabling PCS to extract timely summaries and track its programs, interventions, and resources. However, a detailed data interpretation (data dictionary) is necessary for cases when data scientists and other staff need to work on data-informed tasks.

The Theory of Change data in Insightly, categorized by different phases, specific programs, and outcomes, allows for tracking specific metrics aligned with the Theory of Change model for each member. However, it appears somewhat complex when organized into a single column. PCS should consider a new data collection method for membership activities and program tracking data, as it is crucial for member engagement and progress reports, as well as performance metrics such as data on players' performance, skills, rankings, and improvements. Additionally, some metrics, like staff grading of guided-phase outcomes, are subjective and can lead to inconsistency in data analysis.

1. Project Context:
   
THE ASK: Create a Tableau dashboard that builds upon an existing Theory of Change (TOC) tracking tool.

○ Understand who is coming to PCS, when they are coming, and what they are doing

2. Our goals:

◦ Create a Tableau dashboard that provides PCS with views of

- Individual member TOC journeys
- Organization-wide TOC progress
-  Key operational metrics
  
◦ Ensure our data-to-dashboard process is easy for PCS staff to update and repeat with future data
